####9.2 Mutual Exclusion: sync.Mutex

The 3rd solution for race_condition(data race)
Using buffered channel to limit the number of goroutines accessing the variable to one. 
A binary_semaphore

see ex. bank2

This common pattern of mutual exclusion is useful that is supported by sync.Mutex package/type. 
The Lock method acquires the token 'lock' and 'Unlock' releases
see ex. bank3

####9.3 Read/Write Mutexes: sync.RWMutex

multiple readers, single writer lock:
many read-only functions to run in parallel but write operations
have full exclusive access. This prevents too many read requests 
from locking up the variable.

sync.RWMutex is the provided lock for this

ex 
```
var mu syn.RWMutex
var balance int

func Balance() int {
    mu.Rlock() //readers lock
    defer mu.Runlock()
    return balance
}
```


####9.4 Memory Synchronization

####9.5 Lazy Initialization: sync.Once

Init variables in the beginning can cause longer start up 
and could not even be used. Lazy init, init the variables when 
it is going to be used.

To make concurrent-safe different goroutines accessing 
to check to init can incorrectly assume. Using a mutex can
synchronize and guard, making sure its only init once.

And since init will only write once, a read write mutex would be 
good for the multiple reads.

sync has a sync.Once that does this easy.

ex
```go
var loadIconsOnce sync.Once
var icons map[string]image.Image

//concurrency-safe
func Icon(name string) image.Image {
    loadIconsOnce.Do(loadIcons)
    return icons[name]
}
```

####9.6 The Race Detector
The Go tools includes -race to go build, go run, and go test
Records all accesses to shared variables with id of the goroutine.

####9.7 Example: Concurrent Non-blocking cache

memo4 uses duplicate suppression to avoid the redundant work of two goroutines 
reading from the empty cache and overwriting each other.

A map will have a pointer to structs that contain the function that is cached 
but in addition contains a channel called "ready". After entry is set the channel 
will be closed and broadcast(8.9) to any other goroutines that it is now ready to be 
read.
