This is a test to see how fast i can to see how fast i can type, but i think that maybe that the browns would have better but this is a high response to the keys. Delete on the left side does make ergonomic sense. 
Calm my poor brain from all its woes. Yes, calm your mind. The touch is a little to sensitive for me. You guessed that I think that I would not be able to adapt but you were wrong and I think that I can make this work.

    This is still a very nice keyboard, smooth but I when I hit the wrong key 
    it goes a bit pear-shaped.
    This I One Of The Most Intersting Items I have ever enjoyed typing on but you can see for yourself if you like the keyboard or not it is a very soft keyboard and some might like it a lot but for others The Big Brown Switches Are the most Intersing for me. This Is The Most Interesting keyboard but dont take my word for it. Try for Yourself And see if the Differences are enough to sell You for a new keyboard! were it to see the daylighThis way to soft for me I need to get some browns right away!7777777777777777777777 Hello khow are you doing baby girl this is the very light keyboard so soft way to soft for me hmmmmm but maybe i can get use to this i just have to type very lightly and not distrupt any keys that i shouldnt be typing with anyways
}

This is might be too light and soft for my taste but who knows maybe this is the way to go and not go for the browns with I think I would probably like the most. hhhhhhhhkhkkhhh                hahdhahfHow do the willow blow if just being used by a a few boies hello hello this is quite neat how about I look at your feet?????????

This is Not the only way to write and type but who knows if there are others ways to tt*#wadasdwddddddddddddsadwdasdwsdwadsdwdsdwsdawasdadasdwadwadwasdwadsdwasdwadwasdwadsdsssddwadsdwadsdwadsdwadddddddddwddddsssssssssaddwadwadqrddqwdswadwaswdjhelow how are tyou doing this is quite a bit of a mess isnt it?
